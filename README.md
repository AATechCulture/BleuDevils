# AirDine

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
* How might we make  snack and beverage service on flights seamless and straightforward for flight attendants and passengers? 
* How might we help to decrease the language barrier in place when asking for snacks and beverages on a flight?


## Project Description 🤯
AirDine is a user-friendly, multilingual app that streamlines the snack and drink ordering experience before or during your flight. By seamlessly integrating the Google Translate API, we've taken inclusivity to new heights, offering translations for items in both Spanish and French. Our mission is to make in-flight ordering effortless, allowing passengers to tailor their choices and save time while providing airlines with an efficient, revenue-boosting solution. AirDine transforms air travel into a more enjoyable and convenient journey for all."

## Project Value 💰
AirDine adds value to the airline industry because it reduces passengers' wait time for in-flight service, and allows them to have more options for refreshment purchases in flight. It also allows for more inclusive options for passengers with dietary restrictions thanks to the range of snack and drink options. It will reduce the amount of inflight movement creating an overall safer flight experience.
